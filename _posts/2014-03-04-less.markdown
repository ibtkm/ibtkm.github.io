I'm a developer being here to write about things I cate about: Computer Science, Programming and Web development. In my daily life, I follow lots of related stuffs and confront with interesing contents about CS,development,tech,web and etc. I really enjoy of selecting them and write about them here. In fact I love to share cool hacks, snippets, daily issues and my new experiences in my job as a Rails developer or as a CS student and talk about them here.
I'll also write about Linux which is my favorite OS and as a good friend being with me at nights while coding.
