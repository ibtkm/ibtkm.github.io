<p>Well, let&#39;s start with a story. I have multiple twitter accounts. I tweet in Persian in the first one and English in the second one. as you&#39;ve already guessed, there is an issues with switching between these two easily and quickly. I&#39;ve seen TweetDeck but I don&#39;t feel comfortable with it as I feel in the twitter itself.<br>
recently I found a solution(you can call it a trick) to get over with this situation. that is keeping their(individual sessions) cookies alive and separated  but what does it mean? the answer is in the &quot;how does signing out happen?&quot;. isn&#39;t it just expiring the current cookie?
<br>in this solution, we create two separate profiles for each cookie. In one we login to one of the accounts and in the another we login to another account. whenever we want, we can switch between these two cookie profiles and by refreshing the page, we can actually switch between accounts.<br>
How did I find it? well, I was searching through Google and found somebody saying something like &quot;<font color='red'>I needed something like this so I wrote a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitcher-twitter-account/gmngpagflejjoblmmamaonmnkghjmebh">chrome extension</a> for it</font>&quot; and here is where it begins. I love this common pattern. what pattern? this pattern: &quot;<font color='red'>I needed so I created</font>&quot;. It&#39;s the golden rule of geeks or even hackers. getting your hands dirty and solving your problem is a remarkable and valuable activity a computer geek or hacker can do. if you are a developer or a computer geek, your mission is to create new stuffs that people want and solve their problems or at least create new stuffs that you enjoy of and can be proud of.<br>whenever you see the codes, you say, hell yeah! I wrote those rubies.
<br>improve the computers&#39; world and make people astonished by your creatures and your creativity. how? whenever you confront with an issue, try to solve it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a developer being here to write about things I cate about: Computer Science, Programming and Web development. In my daily life, I follow lots of related stuffs and confront with interesing contents about CS,development,tech,web and etc. I really enjoy of selecting them and write about them here. In fact I love to share cool hacks, snippets, daily issues and my new experiences in my job as a Rails developer or as a CS student and talk about them here.
I&#39;ll also write about Linux which is my favorite OS and as a good friend being with me at nights while coding.</p>
